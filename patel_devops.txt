DevOps Tutorial
- DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.

What are the Different Phases of the DevOps lifecycle
This section will delve into the different phases of the DevOps lifecycle in some detail.

Plan – The planning phase is exactly what it sounds like: planning the project’s lifecycle. In contrast to conventional methods to the development lifecycle, this model assumes that each stage will be repeated as necessary. In this manner, the DevOps workflow is planned with the likelihood of future iterations and likely prior versions in mind.

This implies that we will likely have information from past iterations that will better inform the next iteration, and that the present iteration will likewise inform the next iteration. This stage often involves all teams to ensure that no area of the planning is ignored or forgotten.
Code – The developers will write the code and prepare it for the next phase during the coding stage. Developers will write code in accordance with the specifications outlined in the planning phase and will ensure that the code is created with the project’s operations in mind.
Build – Code will be introduced to the project during the construction phase, and if necessary, the project will be rebuilt to accommodate the new code. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, although GitHub or a comparable version control site is frequently used.

The developer will request the addition of the code, which will then be reviewed as necessary. The request will be approved if the code is ready to be uploaded, and the code will be added to the project. Even when adding new features and addressing bugs, this method is effective.
Test – Throughout the testing phase, teams will do any necessary testing to ensure the project performs as planned. Teams will also test for edge and corner case issues at this stage. An “edge case” is a bug or issue that only manifests during an extreme operating event, whereas a “corner case” occurs when many circumstances are met.
Release – The release phase occurs when the code has been verified as ready for deployment and a last check for production readiness has been performed. The project will subsequently enter the deployment phase if it satisfies all requirements and has been thoroughly inspected for bugs and other problems.
Deploy – In the deploy phase, the project is prepared for the production environment and is operating as planned in that environment. This would be the responsibility of the operations team; in DevOps, it is a shared responsibility. This shared duty pushes team members to collaborate to guarantee a successful deployment.
Operate – In the operating phase, teams test the project in a production environment, and end users utilise the product. This crucial stage is by no means the final step. Rather, it informs future development cycles and manages the configuration of the production environment and the implementation of any runtime requirements.
Monitor – During the monitoring phase, product usage, as well as any feedback, issues, or possibilities for improvement, are recognized and documented. This information is then conveyed to the subsequent iteration to aid in the development process. This phase is essential for planning the next iteration and streamlines the pipeline’s development process.
